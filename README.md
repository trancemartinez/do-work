# Do Work

A SwiftUI app for adaptive workout logging powered by GPT-driven natural language input.

## Progress

- âœ… Core SwiftData models defined:
  - `Exercise`, `ExerciseAlias`
  - `Effort` (linked to `Exercise` and `Session`)
  - `Session` (groups multiple `Efforts`)
  - `UserProfile` (stores user info and unit preferences)
  - `BodyMetrics` (historical tracking of physical data)
- âœ… Relationships modeled using inverse keys
- âœ… Canonical units stored; display units derived via `UserProfile` preferences
- âœ… Architecture uses native SwiftUI patterns (`@Observable`, `@Query`, `@Environment`)
- âœ… Basic GPT integration scaffolding and test coverage in place

## Next

- ðŸš§ Build out the GPT NLP service
- ðŸš§ Create UI for natural language input and session views
- ðŸš§ Add more advanced logging and metric features
